# Initialization of project w/ uv

1. `pip install uv` (unless uv is already installed, in which case skip step 1)
2. `uv sync` (this will re-create all the dependencies based on the `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files)
3. `uv run jupyter lab` (**Note:** you can also just look at the start.bat file and use that)
